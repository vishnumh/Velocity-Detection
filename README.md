# Depth-and-Velocity-Prediction-using-Monocular-Images

This project is largely dervied from Monoflex, AB3MOT and slowfast repository. 

Three approaches are evaluated instead on decoupled representation of cars.

The MViT part is derived from an older commit of slowfast, head is modified to regress for depth and velocity.

#### Inference for Monoflex + AB3MOT
